This document is the vision statement of the W3C Web Payments Interest Group.
It describes a future the group aspires to help achieve, where value exchange
is performed easily and securely on the Open Web Platform. It also provides the
background to the use cases, goals, and architectural vision of the group.
    </p>

This document is a work in progress and is being released early and often
using an agile process; it is currently incomplete.

  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
The World Wide Web has had a tremendous global impact, increasing access to
information and education. However, this has not yet translated into ubiquitous
access to efficient financial systems and the ability to transact with anyone
in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
The Web connected fragmented documentation systems with a common set of
standards. Today’s systems of value exchange lack a set of common standards
and are still proprietary, disconnected, and opaque.
    </p>
    <p>
This document outlines a vision for the Web where value is exchanged as
freely and easily as information. The Web unified varied and disparate
closed information networks through open standards and protocols. In the
same way, the Value Web will create an open and interconnected network
of value exchange linking all of the closed networks that exist today.
    </p>
    <p>
Realizing this vision would have profound and far reaching economic and social
impacts on financial inclusion, development of small businesses, liquidity of
markets, and greater velocity and efficiency of money.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Principles of the Value Web</h2>
    <p>
This vision can only be realised through the collaboration of a variety of
stakeholders united in their agreement with the following principles:
    </p>
    <section>
      <h3>There are many value networks and there always will be</h3>
      <p>
Ownership of anything of value is recorded and tracked within numerous and
diverse networks of trust. The changing ownership or transfer of value within
those networks is recorded in a ledger of some form or another. These ledgers
are maintained by custodians such as...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Commercial and Retail Banks</li>
        <li>Central banks</li>
        <li>Clearinghouses</li>
        <li>Digital wallets</li>
        <li>Registers of deeds</li>
        <li>Stock Exchanges</li>
        <li>Blockchains</li>
        <li>Patent offices</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
… and many more.
      </p>
      <p>
Greater diversity of custodians, ledgers and assets is a good thing, but without
a set of Web standards to connect them, increasing the number and diversity
will quickly become unsustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
The world is tending towards increased global trade and interconnectivity. The
lack of standards is likely to continue to increase costs and stand in the way
of economic progress.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>There are many ways to connect value networks</h3>
      <p>
There are numerous and varied methods of moving value between owners, both within
the same network and between disparate networks. Each one of these methods has
different strengths and weaknesses depending on the scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
Some methods of moving value between owners have higher risks and lower fees.

Others have lower risks and higher fees.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
The open architecture of the Web enables a rapid pace of innovation which has
increasingly resulted in new types of value exchange methods.
      </p>
      <p>
[Illustration - Crypto-currencies]
      </p>
      <p>
This vision embraces all of these existing technologies as well as those that
are in active development today.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>Value moves as freely as information on the Web</h3>
      <p>
The Web increased efficiency and lowered costs of information exchange by many
orders of magnitude. These sorts of efficiency gains are possible via the Web
for the exchange of value.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>The Value Web is open and accessible</h3>
      <p>
It is a long-standing W3C principal to create a Web that can be used by all people
on any device. Nobody is arbitrarily denied access to the Internet of Value.
      </p>
      <p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>The Value Web is built on trust and security</h3>
      <p>
Value exchange on the Web is done in an environment of honesty and trust built on
secure and resilient systems. It provides tools that allow law-abiding consumers,
merchants and financial institutions to have confidence in the individuals and entities
with whom they transact, to be free to choose who those individuals and entities are,
and to be able to trust that these counterparties are who they claim to be.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>The Value Web is simultaneously private and transparent</h3>
      <p>
There is a need for transparency in moving value on a global network between entities
that are subject to different legal and regulatory systems in different jurisdictions.
However, privacy as a fundamental right of all participants.
      </p>
      <p>
The future of value exchange via the Web offers the transparency required for all
participants to operate within the law but ensures that the privacy of participants
is always guaranteed, through the use of secure open protocols incorporating end-to-end
data protection.
      </p>

      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>No single entity controls the Value Web</h3>
      <p>
The Web is a public good and is not subject to the whims of one group or another. It is
distributed, global, and neutral with respect to payment networks, currencies,
technologies, service providers, and participating entities.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>The Value Web is built on open standards</h3>
      <p>
In order for value networks, settlement systems, and related services to compete on a
level playing field, the foundations of value exchange via the Web must be open, transparent,
and neutral. Customers, merchants, financial institutions, and governments stand to benefit
from a strong foundation built on open standards..
      </p>
      <p>
The Value Web is built on OpenStand’s <a href="http://open-stand.org/about-us/principles/">five
principles for modern standards</a> and it’s standards are free to acquire, free to adopt,
and not encumbered by patents.
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h3>The Value Web is simple and extensible</h3>
      <p>
Today’s financial system is complex and one of the key challenges for the architects of the Web
will be to abstract key areas of complexity and create a simple, universal framework that supports
existing systems while enabling a smooth transition to more advanced, extensible, and equitable
systems.
      </p>
      <p>
Rules and regulations around the world differ widely. By creating an extensible set of standards,
the Web enables individuals or entire value networks to work out the details that are relevant
to them. This provides institutions with the flexibility to comply with their local regulations
and follow their local customs while connecting globally.
      </p>
      <p>
The standards for value exchange on the Web should be clearly documented to lower the barrier to
entry for any entity that wishes to integrate with, or extend it.

    <h2>Building an Equitable Global Economy via the Web</h2>
    <p>
The Web connects three billion people today and will connect at least three billion more by the
year 2020. It is ubiquitous and that ubiquity will only grow over the next decade. The Web is the
best connector of information systems that exists today, but there is still much work that needs
to be done when connecting the economic systems and value networks that span the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
It is our vision to connect the economic systems of the world via the Web using the principles
outlined in this document. Doing so will result in an global architecture for value exchange, built
openly, secure by design, and accessible to all.
