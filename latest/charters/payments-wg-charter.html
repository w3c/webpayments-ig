    <h1 id="title">[DRAFT] Web Payments Working Group Charter</h1>

    <p class="mission">The mission of the Web Payments Working Group is to make payments easier and more secure on the
      Web, through incremental improvements to Web infrastructure that support and facilitate payments.   </p>

   <p> Fragmentation of the payment landscape is limiting the
   full potential of the Web, including lack of standards in areas
   such as:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>the high level flow of a Web payment;</li>
	    <li>the programming interfaces between the
            various parties (such as between user agent and Web application);</li>
	    <li>the messages exchanged between these
              parties over the Web.</li>
	</ul>

    <p>The standards from this Working Group will reduce some areas
      of fragmentation, producing benefits such as:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Streamlined <a href="#payment_flow">payment flow</a>, which is expected to reduce the percentage of
            transactions abandoned prior to completion ("shopping cart abandonment").
        </li>
        <li>Increased customer satisfaction due to additional payment options available to users (achieved by decoupling the payer's user agents, <a href="#digital-wallet">digital wallets</a>, and <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a>).</li>
        <li>Improved transparency and confidence in digital payments for consumers as a result of increased choice and
            standardized flows and experiences.
        </li>
        <li>Improved security and privacy by providing information only to those parties that require it to complete a transaction.
        </li>
        <li>Easier integration of new digital payment schemes by payment service providers, increasing the variety of digital payment instruments accepted by payees.
        </li>
	   <li>Easier deployment of <a href="#digital_wallets">digital wallets</a> from banks, retailers, mobile operators,
            card networks, and other providers, enabling innovation and differentiation from value-added services based on location, mobile banking, marketing relationships, and so on.
        </li>
        <li>Lower costs for merchants due to easier adoption of new instruments.
        </li>
        <li>Added value through machine-readable digital payment requests and payment responses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

    <p>Under this charter, the Working Group defines standards that ease integration of the payments ecosystem
      into the Web for a payment initiated within a Web application.</p>

    <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

	<p>The Working Group will standardize a set of messages and a
message flow for the initiation, confirmation, and completion of a
payment. The scope of the charter is the interaction between payer
user agent and payee Web application. Deliverables from this group
will increase interoperability between payer and payee systems (for
existing and future <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment schemes</a>), and encourage greater
automation of the steps in a typical payment.</p>

	<p>By addressing message format and flow, the group
leaves open the standardization of the delivery mechanism for these
messages as this will vary depending on the use case and technology
stack. To support use cases where messages are proxied between payer
and payee using different technologies, the group will standardize
delivery mechanisms for common scenarios. This will include JavaScript
APIs for the use cases where the messages are proxied between payer
and payee via a Web browser and additional APIs where the messages
are exchanged directly over the Web between two online entities.

	<p>This group is chartered to standardize programming
	interfaces; not user interfaces. This group will not define a
	new <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment
	    scheme</a>.</p>

	<h3 id="definitions">Definitions</h3>

	<dl>
	  <dt id="digital-payment-scheme"><strong>digital payment scheme</strong></dt>
	  <dd>A payment scheme is a set of rules and technical standards for the execution of payment transactions that are followed by adhering entities (payment processors, payers and payees). A digital payment scheme is one where transactions take place over digital networks (such as the Web). Some digital payment schemes make use internally of payment instruments from other payment schemes. How they register and communicate with internal payment instruments is beyond the scope of this charter. </dd>
	  <dt id="digital-payment-instrument"><strong>digital payment instrument</strong></dt>
	  <dd>A payment instrument is an account, token or other means of
	    conducting a transaction according to a payment scheme. A digital
	    payment instrument is one that is associated with a digital
	    payment scheme.</dd>
	  <dt id="digital-wallet"><strong>digital wallet</strong></dt>
	  <dd>A wallet is a container for payment instruments that affords access
	    to them. A digital wallet holds digital payment instruments.</dd>
</dl>

        <h3 id="payment_flow">Payment Flow</h3>

          <p>The scope of work supports the following elements of a
            basic purchase triggered by payment initiation through a
            Web application. These standards define a high-level
            message flow for a payment from payer to payee either in
            the form of a credit push (payer initiated) or a debit
            pull (payee initiated) payment, and can be used to
            facilitate a payment from any <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment scheme</a>. They involve:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Pre-Payment</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Registration</strong>, by the payer with their <a href="#digital-wallet">digital wallet</a>, of any
                        conforming <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instrument</a>.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Negotiation of Terms</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Payment Initiation Request</strong>, by the payee to the payer providing the terms of
                        the payment including elements such as the accepted <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment schemes</a>, price, currency,
                        recurrence, transaction type (purchase, refund, etc.), timeout and requests for any additional
                        data that is required from the payee.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Negotiation of Payment Instruments</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Discovery</strong>, by the payer, of their available <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a> that can be
                        used to make the payment. This is done by matching those registered by the payer with those
                        supported by the payee (as defined in the Payment Initiation Request), while keeping information
                        local to
                        the payer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Selection of a digital payment instrument</strong> by the payer, confirmation of the terms, and
                        sending of any requested data back to the payee for validation.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
            <dt>Payment Processing and Completion</dt>
            <dd>
                <ul>
                    <li>Execution of the payment by either payer or payee.</li>
                    <li>Delivery of a <strong>Payment Completion</strong> generated by the entity that executed the
                        payment. This may contain a <strong>Proof of Payment</strong> if supported by the payment
                        scheme.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>The group will also address exceptions that may occur during these steps, including payment authorization
          failure, lack of available digital wallet service, and lack of suitable
   registered <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a>.</p>

		<h3 id="digital_wallets">Relation to Digital Wallets</h3>

		<p> This Working Group intends to create a standard
  programming interface from the Web to a payer's digital wallet so
  that someone with a conforming digital wallet can seamlessly make
  payments with a conforming application running in a conforming user
  agent.  Because the "digital wallet" concept means different things
  to different audiences this charter includes
  the <a href="#digital-wallet">above definition</a> to clarify the
  intent of this group.</p>

		        <p>This group is not developing standards for loyalty
  schemes and coupons, digital receipts, digital credentials,
  tickets, and location services.  Future W3C activities may seek to
  increase interoperability of these or other additional digital wallet
  capabilities.</p>

		<p>The group may define APIs that will also be used
   outside of a user agent context, such as between Web services, or
   from within a native application (where the browser is not the
   proxy between digital wallet and payee application).</p>

	<h4>On Multiple Digital Wallets</h4>

	  <p>In the design of these standards, the Working Group will not assume that each user has only one digital wallet. In this charter, the phrase "the payer's digital wallet" is shorthand for "the payer's digital wallet(s)" as the payer may have multiple digital wallets.</p>

	   <p>The Working Group may consider the use case where an aggregation service acts as a more sophisticated digital wallet service or provides a wider choice of payment solutions to the payer. For example, the aggregator service might combine the functionality of multiple digital wallet services, or apply more complex algorithms to discover and collect the set of <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment
            instruments</a> available to the payer.</p>

        <h3 id="security">Security and Privacy Considerations</h3>

	<p>Security is obviously critical in payments.</p>

	<p>For the APIs defined by this group, a key consideration is
 the ability to prove message integrity and authentication of all
 message originators. This group will work with the organizations
 listed in the liaisons section of the charter to help ensure API
 security.</p>

       <p> There are other aspects of security (e.g., authentication
 of payer identity) that this group will leave to the <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment schemes</a>.
 This group will not define authentication standards (e.g.,
 hardware-based solutions in securing transactions, or authenticating
 users via biometry or other mechanisms) but should be aware of
 industry developments to help ensure compatibility with the flows
 defined by this group.</p>

       <p>In addition, W3C is developing additional security-related
 specifications in other groups that may be adopted in <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment
 schemes</a>. This group will follow that work to help ensure
 compatibility with the payment flow standards described in this
 charter.</p>

       <p>Protection of the privacy of all participants in a payment
 is essential to maintaining the trust that payment systems are
 dependent upon to function. A payment process defined by this group
 should not disclose private details of the participants identity or
 other sensitive information as part of the payment process unless
 required by operational, legal or jurisdictional rules, or when
 deliberately consented to (e.g. as part of a loyalty program) by the
 owner of the information. The design of any public facing API should
 guard against the unwanted leakage of such data through exploitation
 of the API.</p>

	   <h3>Relation to Regulatory Requirements</h3>

	<p><a href="#digital-payment-scheme">Digital payment schemes</a> define how various parties meet relevant regulatory obligations. The deliverables of this group should not prevent parties from meeting those obligations.</p>

        <h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h2>

        <h3 id="Web_Payments_APIs">Web Payments APIs Recommendation</h3>

        <p>Web Payments APIs will seek to increase interoperability for the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Digital Payment Scheme Description</strong>: used by payees to represent accepted 
                schemes, and by payers to represent their available schemes and instruments.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Payment Terms Description</strong>: used to define the terms requested by the payee in the
                payment initiation request and the terms accepted by the payer in the payment initiation response. It
                includes information such as amount, currency, payee account information, recurrence, transaction
                reference and any scheme-specific data that is required.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proof of Payment</strong>: a payment authorization from the account provider to the
                payee. The proof must include information about the payment request (a transaction reference or similar)
                and the payer's <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instrument</a>.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>It will include standard request and response messages for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Registration of a Digital Payment Instrument</strong>: A payer digital wallet service processes a registration
                request and, with user mediation as required, adds a new <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instrument</a> to the payer's digital wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Web Payment Initiation</strong>: The payee passes a payment request to a payer digital wallet service
                which returns the details of the payment initiation response. The payer should be presented with a set
                of <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a> for selection and prompted to provide any other required data to pass back to the
                payee.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Web Payment Completion</strong>: The payee passes a payment completion request to a payer digital wallet
                service which returns the details of the payment completion response. If the payment was payer-initiated,
                this is the trigger for the digital wallet service to execute the payment; otherwise this is a message
                advising of the result of a payee initiated payment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It will specify the delivery mechanism for these messages in at least the following scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Web application to user agent integration</strong>: Where the payment messages may be proxied between a Web application and the payer's digital wallet service via a JavaScript API hosted by the user agent.
            </li>
            <li><strong>User agent to server-side wallet communication</strong>: Where request messages are passed to a server-side wallet service, for example via HTTP, JavaScript, or some other approach.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Inter-app on mobile devices (Optional)</strong>: If possible the group will standardize a delivery mechanism for payment messages between apps on a mobile device so that digital wallet apps can seamlessly interface with Websites running inside the mobile device's user agent.
            </li>
        </ul>

	<h4>Interoperability Success Criteria</h4>

	<p>The group will seek interoperability between two user
   agents and two services that enable payers to use <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment
   instruments</a>.</p>

	<h3 id="optional">Optional Deliverables</h3>
        <h4 id="Card_Payments">Card Payments Recommendation</h4>

        <p>A very large proportion of payments on the Web are conducted using payment cards from one of the global card
            schemes. The group should attempt to define a standardized specialization of the payment flow specifically
            for payment cards.</p>

        <p>A generic card payment Recommendation could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrate how a debit-pull digital payment scheme should be implemented using Web Payments APIs.
            </li>
            <li>Take advantage of new security technologies such as EMVco Tokenization to improve on the existing
                methods of using cards on the Web.
            </li>
            <li>Standardize a common approach for payment card schemes
 globally to kick-start adoption of Web Payments APIs.
            </li>
        </ul>

      <h3 id="wpig">Web Payments Interest Group</h3>

      <p>The <a href="/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a> acts as the overall coordinator at W3C of a vision for Web Payments, by gathering <a
                    href="/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">Web Payments Use Cases</a>, engaging in liaisons with other payments standards bodies, and developing a high-level architecture. The group intends to explore more eCommerce scenarios than are represented in the current Working Group charter, such as digital receipts; loyalty programs and coupons; peer-to-peer payments; and harmonization of user
      experience in-browser, in-app, and in-store.</p>

<p>From time to time, the Interest Group will seek feedback from the Working Group on its evolving vision, and share information about the evolution of the Web payments technology landscape. The Interest Group may also propose new Working Groups to cover topics such as identity, credentials and commerce (including invoicing, receipts,
        loyalty programs, coupons, discounts, and offers). The Web Payments Interest Group also expects to provide technical input to this and other
        relevant W3C Working Groups, based on a detailed analysis of the relevant <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">Web Payments Use
		Cases</a>.</p>

    <div class="participation">
        <h2 id="participation">Participation</h2>

        <p>To be successful, the Web Payments Working Group is expected to have 10 active participants for its duration.
            Effective participation in Web Payments Working Group may consume .1 FTE for each participant; for editors
          this commitment may be higher.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="communication">
        <h2 id="communication">Communication</h2>

        <p>This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list public-payments-wg@w3.org (archive).
            Administrative tasks may be conducted in Member-only communications.</p>

        <p>Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is
            available from the Web Payments Working Group home page.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="decisions">
        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this
            group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When a Chair puts a question and observes
            dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should put a question out for voting
            within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email and/or
            web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be
            considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.</p>

        <p>Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference (i.e., that does not follow a 7 day
            call for consensus on the mailing list) is to be considered provisional until 5 working days after the
            publication of the draft resolution. If no
            objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have
            consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>
