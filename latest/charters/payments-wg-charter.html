    <p>Under this initial charter, the Working Group defines standards that ease integration of the payments ecosystem
      into the Web for a payment initiated by a Web application.</p>


    <p>We anticipate the following benefits of this work:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Streamlined <a href="#payment_flow">payment flow</a>, which is expected to reduce the percentage of
            transactions abandoned prior to completion ("shopping cart abandonment").
        </li>
        <li>Increased customer satisfaction due to additional payment options available to users (achieved by decoupling the payer's user agents, digital wallets, and payment instruments).</li>
        <li>Improved transparency and confidence in digital payments for consumers as a result of increased choice and
            standardised flows and experiences.
        </li>
        <li>Improved security and privacy by providing information only to those parties that require it to complete a
            transaction.
        </li>
        <li>Easier integration of new payment schemes by payment service providers, increasing the variety of payment
            instruments accepted by payees.
        </li>
	   <li>Easier deployment of <a href="#wallets">digital wallets</a> from banks, retailers, mobile operators,
            card networks, and other providers, enabling innovation and differentiation from value-added services based on location, mobile banking, marketing relationships, and so on.
        </li>
        <li>Lower costs for merchants due to increased competition between payment instrument providers and easier
            adoption of new instruments.
        </li>
        <li>Added value through machine-readable digital payment requests and payment responses.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Web Payments Interest Group will continue to guide the W3C in the Web Payments activity and may propose new
        Working Groups to cover topics such as identity, credentials and commerce (including invoicing, receipts,
        loyalty programs, coupons, discounts, and offers).</p>

    <p>As part of this work the Web Payments Interest Group expects to provide technical input to this and other
        relevant W3C Working Groups, based on a detailed analysis of the relevant <a
                href="http://www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">Web Payments Use
            Cases</a>.</p>

    <p>The W3C is also planning other Working Groups to develop standards, covering topics such as security, that will
        be important in facilitating payments on the Web.</p>

    <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>

        <p>A payment, on the Web today, ordinarily starts on a payment page where the <strong>payer</strong> must
            manually select a <strong>payment scheme</strong>, manually select their own <strong>payment instrument</strong> for that
            payment scheme, manually capture the details of that instrument into the page (along with any other
            essential data such as a shipping address) and then submit this data back to the <strong>payee.</strong> The
            payment data briefly passes through the Web (from the payer's user agent to the payee's Website) on its way
            to a payment processor. At that point, much of the communication to complete a payment takes place among
            banks, card networks, and other parties in the payment ecosystem typically outside of the Web.</p>

        <p>In an effort to improve upon this process, various parties have innovated ways to make the payment flow
            easier, for example by caching payment instrument information in browsers, registering users on eCommerce
            websites to facilitate re-use of customer data and/or payment credentials (increasingly through the use of
            tokenization), and even developing new payment schemes. Unfortunately, these efforts suffer from a lack
          of standardization in areas such as:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>the high level flow of a Web payment;</li>
	    <li>the interfaces between the
            various parties (such as between user agent and Web application);
	    <li>the messages exchanged between these
              parties over the Web.</li>
	    </ul>
	      <p>The result is that users are led through entirely different flows and verification
            routines every time they make a payment on the Web.</p>

        <p>This group will create open Web standards for the <em>interfaces</em> in and out of the Web context to
            provide
            interoperability between payer and payee systems (for existing and future payment schemes), and encourage
            greater automation of the steps in a typical payment. The interfaces between the payment schemes and the Web
            are usually at the user agent and the Web application, therefore the scope of the initial charter is focused
            on the interactions between these two components and the external actors that will interface directly with
          them. <strong>Note:</strong> These standards may also prove useful in a "native" application context, but this group is not focused on that use case.</p>

        <p>The group will focus primarily on standardisation of a set of messages and a message flow for the initiation,
            confirmation and completion of a payment. By focusing on the message format and flow the group leaves open
            the standardisation of the delivery mechanism for these messages as this will vary depending on the use case
            and technology stack. To support use cases where messages are proxied between payer and payee using
            different technologies, the group will standardize delivery mechanisms for common scenarios. This
            will include WebIDL APIs for the use cases where the messages are proxied between payer and payee via a Web
            browser or Web APIs where the messages are exchanged directly over the Web between two online entities in
            the classic REST pattern.</p>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> The W3C <a href="/Payments/IG/">Web Payments Interest Group</a> expects to continue to explore a wider variety of eCommerce scenarios, including digital receipts; loyalty programs and coupons; peer-to-peer payments; and harmonization of user
            experience in-browser, in-app, and in-store. For more information, see the <a
                    href="/TR/web-payments-use-cases/">Payments Use Cases</a> published by the W3C Web
            Payments Interest Group. Through its liaison with the Web Payments Interest Group, this Working Group should remain aware of the evolution of the Web payments technology landscape.</p>

        <h3 id="payment_flow">Payment Flow</h3>

        <p>The scope of work supports the following elements of a basic purchase triggered by user interaction with a
            Web application initiating a new payment. These standards define a high-level message flow for a payment
            from payer to payee either in the form of a credit push (payer initiated) or a debit pull (payee initiated)
            payment, and can be used to facilitate a payment from any payment scheme.</p>

                        recurrence, transaction type (purchase, refund, etc.), timeout and requests for any additional
                        data that is required from the payee.

                        supported by the payee (as defined in the Payment Initiation Request), while keeping information
                        local to
                        the payer.

            <img src="images/WebPaymentsBasicPaymentFlow.png" alt="Web Payments Basic Payment Flow"/>
        </figure>

        <p>The group will also address exceptions that may occur during these steps, including payment authorization
            failure.</p>

        <h3 id="security">Security and Privacy Considerations</h3>

        <p>Security is obviously critical in payments. While the initial work of the group will leave much of the
            required security and authentication (e.g., encryption and digital signatures) to payment schemes, it is important to ensure that any additions to
            the Web platform are secure and tamper-proof. The ability to manipulate any message in a payment flow has
            potentially massive financial impact. Therefore the ability to prove message integrity and verification of
            all message originators should be a key consideration for any work done by the group.</p>

        <p>The group will follow the work of other W3C groups working on hardware-based security standards to help ensure compatibility with the payment flow standards produced by this Working Group. In particular, this group will consider how hardware-based solutions may be used to generate
            and store secrets for secure transactions, and how hardware devices may be used to verify a user's
          authenticity via biometry or other mechanisms.</p>

	        <p>Protection of the privacy of all participants in a payment is essential to maintaining the trust that payment
            systems are dependent upon to function. Any payment process defined by the group should not require
            disclosure of private details of any of the participants' identity or other sensitive information without
            their explicit consent. The design of any public facing API should ensure it is not possible for such
            data to be leaked through exploitation of the API.</p>

        <h3 id="wallets">Relation to Wallets</h3>

        <p>The standards from this group may be implemented in a variety of ways, including within stand-alone Web or
            native applications, within applications in the Cloud, within user agents such as Web browsers, or in the
            form of user agent extensions or plug-ins. Some of the capabilities provided by the standards from this
            group can be found in today's digital wallets and various other Web services. Because the "digital
            wallet" concept is useful as a shorthand, but means different things to different audiences, this charter
            includes the following definition to clarify the intent of this group.</p>

        <p>In this charter we define a <strong>wallet</strong> as a software service, providing similar functions in the
            digital world to those provided by a physical wallet, namely:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It holds and allows access to payment instruments registered by the payer.</li>
            <li>It provides logic to support certain payment schemes and enables the payer to use registered payment
                instruments to
                execute a payment in accordance with the rules and processes of that scheme.
            </li>
            <li>It may hold digital assets, in the form of one or more account balances, that can be used to make
                payments.
            </li>
            <li>It may enrich the payment flow by implementing business logic for loyalty, coupons, ticketing or other
                function that is complimentary to its payment capabilities.
            </li>
        </ul>
          <p>This group is not developing standards for all digital wallet capabilities: this charter's scope is limited to payment flow capabilities. At the same time, this definition of wallet is not intended to constrain W3C's future activities. Indeed, W3C anticipates a rich ecosystem of eCommerce and payment
            functionality on the Web, including loyalty schemes and coupons, digital receipts, digital credentials, location services, marketing
            additions, and more. Some of this functionality may be provided by a digital wallet, or by other services
            available to the payer. This charter does not seek to preclude those additional services, and in the future
            W3C may look for opportunities increase the interoperability of such services. The wallet metaphor appropriate to this charter may change in future charters or may be dropped if no longer relevant.</p>

        <p>This Working Group intends to create a standard interface from the Web to a payer's wallet so that someone with any
            conforming wallet can seamlessly make payments with any conforming application running in a conforming
            user agent. The group may define APIs that will also be used outside of a user agent context (such as
            between
            Web services, or from within a native application, where the browser is not the proxy between wallet and
            payee application).</p>

          <p>The group may also consider the use case where an aggregation service acts as a more sophisticated wallet service or providing a wider choice of payment solutions to the payer. For example, the aggregator service might combine the functionality of multiple wallet services, or apply more complex algorithms to discover and collect the set of payment
            instruments available to the payer.</p>

        <h3 id="out_of_scope">Out of Scope</h3>

        <p>This group will not define a new payment scheme, or redefine that which is already addressed today by payment
            schemes. The standards from this group will provide a channel for protocols and messages defined by payment
          schemes.</p>

        <h4 id="Web_Payment_Vocabularies_1.0">Web Payment Vocabularies 1.0</h4>

        <p>The Working Group will develop machine-readable vocabularies (and a mechanism to manage the lifecycle of
            these vocabularies) that enable the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Payment Scheme Description</strong>: this vocabulary is used by payees to represent accepted
                schemes, and by payers to represent their available payment schemes and instruments.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Payment Terms Description</strong>: used to define the terms requested by the payee in the
                payment initiation request and the terms accepted by the payer in the payment initiation response. It
                includes information such as amount, currency, payee account information, recurrence, transaction
                reference and any scheme specific data that is required.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proof of Payment</strong>: a verifiable payment authorization from the account provider to the
                payee. The proof must include information about the payment request (a transaction reference or similar)
                and the payer's payment instrument.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="Web_Payments_1.0">Web Payments 1.0</h4>

        <p>The Working Group will define standard request and response messages for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Registration of a Payment Instrument</strong>: A payer wallet service processes a registration
                request and, with user mediation as required, adds a new payment instrument to the payer's wallet.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Web Payment Initiation</strong>: The payee passes a payment request to a payer wallet service
                which returns the details of the payment initiation response. The payer should be presented with a set
                of payment instruments for selection and prompted to provide any other required data to pass back to the
                payee.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Web Payment Completion</strong>: The payee passes a payment completion request to a payer wallet
                service which returns the details of the payment completion response. If this was a payer-initiated
                payment, this is the trigger for the wallet service to execute the payment otherwise this is a message
                advising of the result of a payee initiated payment.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Working group will standardize the delivery mechanism for these messages in at least the following
            scenarios:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WebIDL/">WebIDL</a> API</strong>: Where the payment messages may
                be proxied between a Web application and the payer's wallet service via a WebIDL API hosted by
                the User Agent.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Web services API</strong>: Where request messages may be passed to a Cloud-based wallet service
                via that service's REST API endpoint(s) and where HTTP callbacks may be used to pass responses to other
                Web services.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Inter-app on mobile devices (Optional)</strong>: If possible the group will standardize a
                delivery mechanism for payment messages between apps on a mobile device so that wallet apps can
                seamlessly interface with Websites running inside the mobile device's user agent.
            </li>
        </ul>

	<h3 id="optional">Optional Deliverables</h3>
        <h4 id="Card_Payments_1.0">Card Payments 1.0</h4>

        <p>A very large proportion of payments on the Web are conducted using payment cards from one of the global card
            schemes. The group should attempt to define a standardized specialisation of the payment flow specifically
            for payment cards.</p>

        <p>A generic card payment standard could:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Demonstrate how a debit-pull payment scheme should be implemented using the Web Payments 1.0
                standard.
            </li>
            <li>Take advantage of new security technologies such as EMVco Tokenisation to improve on the existing
                methods of using cards on the Web.
            </li>
            <li>Standardize a single payment scheme that is reusable by all payment card schemes globally to kick-start
                adoption of the Web Payments 1.0 standard.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Development of such a standard will require collaboration by the group with the owners of the existing global
          card schemes.</p>

        <h4 id="best_practices">Instrument Discovery Good Practices</h4>

	<p>This charter does not include a deliverable for a standard mechanism to discover &mdash; via the payer's wallet(s)&mdash; available payment instruments. However, the Working Group may document good practices and recommend algorithms for the discovery of payer payment
            instruments. This involves good practice approaches for discovering the supported payer
            payment instruments given the payer's configured payment instruments and those acceptable to a payee as
            listed in a payment initiation request.</p>

        <h2 id="decisions">Decision Policy</h2>

        <p>As explained in the Process Document (<a href="/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this
            group will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When a Chair puts a question and observes
            dissent, after due consideration of different opinions, the Chair should put a question out for voting
            within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation -- using, for example, email and/or
            web-based survey techniques) and record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then be
            considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available.

        <p>Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference (i.e., that does not follow a 7 day
            call for consensus on the mailing list) is to be considered provisional until 5 working days after the
            publication of the resolution in draft minutes, available from the WG's calendar or home page. If no
            objections are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will be considered to have
            consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.</p>
